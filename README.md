This project is a personal project meant to help me grow my skills and
practice programming, platform system management, and data management.

This is a Recipe and Ingredient management system. This system will allow me to build meal plans
for my family that include ingrediens already in my household based on our preferences and needs.

The first features of this project will include the following:

    1. A database system in mySQL that will have tables of the recipes we use,
    ingredients currently in my household. It will also include ways for me to query
    cooking methods, such as crock pots or the stove, to make it easier for me to play
    my meals.

    2. A python user interface.

    3. A way to generate meal plans based on current ingredients, ingredients needed,
    and the method of cooking I would prefer to have, and if we are using meal prep, meals
    for dinner, and so on.

Future Features will (hopefully) include the following:

    1. A web scraper to pull in recipes from the internet and a way to parse them into my tables.

    2. Including seasonal ingredients when possible.

    3. Meal plans based on a budget.

    4. A favorites system based on meals we frequently use.

    5. An easier method of parsing in the ingredients from shopping trips.
